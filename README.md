Accenture-Developer-Job-Simulation-Course-Tasks
I had the opportunity to participate in the 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐉𝐨𝐛 𝐒𝐢𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 provided by Forage and it was an eye-opening experience! The program delved deep into the world of software development, offering hands-on tasks that simulate real-world scenarios in a developer's role at Accenture.
